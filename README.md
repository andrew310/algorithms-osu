To use, place tspDirector.py in the same directory as greedy.py and slow.py, as well as whatever text input files you will be testing. Run python tspDirector.py (name of your text file) and hit enter. 
it will export a text file of the same name but with .tour at the end.

tspOpSwap.py can be tested using the same method.
